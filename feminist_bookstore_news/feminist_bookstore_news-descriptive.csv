Strongest aspect of fair was its identity as a Women's writing festival. . . ""we were a walking literature of the international women in print movement"" (10). Conference promoted lesbian visibility despite high percentage of lesbian participants. Regret that Global Day and Lesbian Celebration were scheduled to conflict with each other, so people had to decide if they were global or lesbian. Goals of feminist bookfairs should be clearly stated from the start. ""More than anything, an international bookfair needs to provide a cross-fertilization of ideas"" (13).

Customs returned all books. Customs surrender result of protest by lesbian and gay community. “Hindsight guesses, trying to explain the ferocity of the raids, are that Customs came to the bookstore genuinely expecting (hoping?) to find a full-fledged gay pornography outfit importing all their wildest fantasies and that the officers were convinced that somewhere, if they just look under and behind everything, (and in everyone’s bedroom) they would find what they imagined was there. And they didn’t know what to do when they encountered literature. And didn’t know how to back down” (14). Instead of Customs having secret lists of banned topics, now they state in advance whether or not a book contravenes import prohibitions, and the importer can challenge Customs in open court without risking loss of stock/criminal charges.
