# HathiTrust Post45 Fiction Dataset

Author: Ted Underwood

This dataset contains metadata and HathiTrust IDs for fiction held by the [HathiTrust Digital Library](https://www.hathitrust.org/the-collection/) published between 1945 and 2013.

The HathiTrust identifiers included here can be used to extract words per page for all included volumes (using tools such as the [HTRC Feature Reader](https://github.com/htrc/htrc-feature-reader/tree/master)), thus enabling various kinds of computational text analysis on these works.

The dataset also contains ISBSNs, OCLC numbers, and other related OCLC information (such as the number of holdings of each title across WorldCat libraries) for volumes where this information could be identified.

See the Post45 DC [data essay](data.post45.org/hathitrust-post45-fiction/) for more information.
