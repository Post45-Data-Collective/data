The Index of Major Literary Prizes in the US includes two related datasets:

1.  The first is a dataset of the winners and judges of prizes for prose, poetry, or unspecified genre between 1918 and 2020 with a purse of \$10,000 and over.
2.  The second contains records for volumes in the HathiTrust Digital Library written by authors who won a prize in the prize winners dataset.

See the [Post45 DC data essay](https://doi.org/10.18737/CNJV1733p4520221212) for more information.
